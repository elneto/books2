# The Greatest Books Visualized
This project is a mix between <a href="http://thegreatestbooks.org" target="_blank">thegreatestbooks.org</a> and <a href="http://www.goodreads.com" target="_blank">goodreads.com</a>

It takes the ratings from goodreads and it was born from the idea of finding good books to read taking into account the number of pages and the popularity of the book. The popularity is measured by the number of reviews. Given that there is not enough time to read, I wanted to have this tool to help me finding the next book to read.
